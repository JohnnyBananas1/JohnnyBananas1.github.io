		<h3>"Lilith's Game" is the story of couple Hunter and Lily as they discover the secrets of a mysterious video-game that appears on their doorstep. As Hunter becomes enthralled with the game, his line between reality and the video-game begins to blur. <br/>This short film was created for a film production course at Notre Dame with the brutal requirements of telling an entire story without dialogue and without recording sound on set.</h3>
